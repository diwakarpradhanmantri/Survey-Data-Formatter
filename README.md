📌 Project Overview
The Survey Data Formatter project helps clean up raw, unstructured survey data and turn it into a usable format. Many times, survey responses contain inconsistencies like different spellings of "yes", missing fields, or unnecessary columns — all of which make analysis difficult. This project fixes those problems and gets the data ready for charts, reports, or further analysis.

🧩 Key Features

✅ Standardizes inconsistent survey answers (like yes, Y, Yes → Yes)
🧹 Removes incomplete or irrelevant responses
🧾 Deletes columns with no variation or empty values
📊 Visualizes trends using charts (bar, pie, histogram)
💾 Saves a clean and structured dataset for analysis
⚙️ Technologies Used

Python
Pandas – for cleaning and formatting the data
Matplotlib & Seaborn – for generating visuals
PowerPoint – for project presentation (optional)

📁 Final Output
A cleaned .csv file ready for analysis
Visual charts that show patterns in the data
A presentation summarizing the project and its results
